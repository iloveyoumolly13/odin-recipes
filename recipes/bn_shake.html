    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have you noticed that anytime you order a fruity shake at a restaurant, it typically contains fake flavoring? This banana milkshake contains real bananas and few key components that enhances flavor: lemon juice, vanilla, and the smallest amount of cinnamon. The pure banana flavor shines through, making this the best banana shake ever!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Large banana</li>
        <li>1 Cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 scoops vanilla ice cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To the bottom of your blender (a highspeed blender is my first choice, but any blender will work here), add the sliced banana.        </li>
        <li>Next, pour in the milk, vanilla, cinnamon and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Add the three big scoops of ice cream to the blender last.</li>
        Blend everything together until very smooth and creamy. If it's too cold and not blending, add small splashes of milk until the banana milkshake liquifies and is pourable.<li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
    </ol>
