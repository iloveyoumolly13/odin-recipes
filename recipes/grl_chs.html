    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone needs to know how to make a classic grilled cheese sandwich. Whether you're a beginner cook or an old pro, you'll come back to this top-rated grilled cheese recipe again and again.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 slices cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To the bottom of your blender (a highspeed blender is my first choice, but any blender will work here), add the sliced banana.        </li>
        <li>Next, pour in the milk, vanilla, cinnamon and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Add the three big scoops of ice cream to the blender last.</li>
        Blend everything together until very smooth and creamy. If it's too cold and not blending, add small splashes of milk until the banana milkshake liquifies and is pourable.<li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
    </ol>
