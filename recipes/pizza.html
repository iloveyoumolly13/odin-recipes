    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Cups of water</li>
        <li>1/2 Can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 12-inch pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Whisk together water, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, sugar, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside</li>
        <li>Make crust: Combine 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining flour, a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface; knead until dough is smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Add more flour as needed. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Lightly flour your hands, then pat each piece of dough onto the prepared pizza pans.</li>
        <li>Top dough with sauce, cheese, and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly, 18 to 20 minutes. Rotate pizza pans between the top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
